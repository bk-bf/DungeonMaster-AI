## Whispers of Forgotten Skill 🗝️

The *thieves' tools* 🤔 near your hand seem to hum with a faint familiarity, *Testi*. Despite the amnesia, your fingers twitch instinctively, recognizing the intricate arrangement of picks and tension wrenches. The character sheet confirms your proficiency, and the *thieves' cant* language floats faintly in your mind.

Perhaps a flicker of your past life remains, buried beneath the amnesia. You pick up the *thieves' tools*, their cool metal a stark contrast to the clammy stone floor. A wave of nausea washes over you as you focus on the tools, a disjointed image flashing in your mind: a shadowed alleyway, a glint of metal, a hushed whisper... gone as quickly as it came.

You also remember that you have proficiency in *Stealth* and *Sleight of Hand*. Your Dexterity of 16 (+3) makes you naturally nimble, and your *Perception* and *Investigation* skills could be useful.

Do you attempt to use the *thieves' tools* on the door, hoping to bypass a potential lock? Or do you examine them more closely, trying to glean any further clues from their design or condition? Maybe a quick pat-down of your person might reveal a hidden pouch or inscription you missed before.

What will it be, *Testi*? Let your instincts guide you.
