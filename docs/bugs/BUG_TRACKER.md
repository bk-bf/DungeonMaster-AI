### **[ ] BUG-001: Campaign Creation Failure After Collaborative Setup** ‚öôÔ∏è
**Priority:** Critical  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** BLOCKING  
**Reported:** 2025-06-20  
**Component:** Backend - Campaign Management & Context Integration

**Description:**  
After completing collaborative character creation form, no new campaign automatically opens, leaving users in broken state with no clear path forward.

**Impact:**
- **BLOCKS** entire collaborative creation workflow
- Users confused and think system is broken
- No transition from setup to gameplay
- Context system disconnected from campaign state

**Technical Cause:**
```typescript
// In +page.svelte handleCharacterSetupComplete()
function handleCharacterSetupComplete(event: CustomEvent) {
    const { collaborativeMode, preferences } = event.detail;
    showCharacterSetup = false;
    
    if (collaborativeMode) {
        // ‚ùå Campaign creation missing here
        autoStartCollaborativeCreation(preferences);
    }
}
```

**Required Fix:**
```typescript
if (collaborativeMode) {
    // ‚úÖ Create campaign BEFORE starting collaborative creation
    campaignStore.createCampaign("Collaborative Adventure");
    autoStartCollaborativeCreation(preferences);
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 30 minutes  
**Business Value:** Critical (enables core workflow)

### **[ ] BUG-002: Prompt Inspector System Failure** ‚öôÔ∏è
**Priority:** Critical  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** BLOCKING  
**Reported:** 2025-06-20

Prompt inspector fails to show prompts for messages sent during character creation or prior to chat instance initialization.

**Impact:**
- **BLOCKS** debugging capabilities during development
- Cannot inspect collaborative creation prompts
- Missing prompt storage for character creation phase
- Debug workflow completely broken

**Technical Cause:**
- `storePromptForDebugging()` not called during collaborative creation
- Message ID tracking broken during character creation phase
- Prompt storage API not integrated with collaborative flow

**Required Fix:**
```typescript
// In collaborative creation handler
if (promptType === 'collaborative_creation') {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // ‚úÖ Store prompt for debugging
    const currentMessages = messages;
    const lastMessageId = currentMessages[currentMessages.length - 1]?.id;
    if (lastMessageId) {
        await storePromptForDebugging(lastMessageId, prompt, data.response);
    }
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour  
**Business Value:** Critical (development tooling)

### **[ ] BUG-003: LLM Context Window Overflow During Character Creation** ‚öôÔ∏è
**Priority:** Critical  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** BLOCKING  
**Reported:** 2025-06-20  
**Component:** Backend - Prompt Management & Token Limits

**Description:**  
LLM runs out of context during character sheet finalization, cutting off mid-response with incomplete world building.

**Failure Example:**
```
"...2. üåç World Overview

Setting: A dark fantasy world with elements of folklore and monster hunting. Think a Grimm's fairy tale gone wrong. Magic is rare and often dangerous.
The Setting: The world is filled with ancient forests, crumbling ruins, and isolated villages. Monsters and strange creatures lurk in the shadows.
Your Home: A small, remote village nestled near the edge of a vast, ancient forest. The village is relatively peaceful, but whispers of strange disappearances and unsettling events have been circulating for months.
The Forest: The Whispering Woods. A sprawling, ancient forest rumored to be home to all manner of dangerous creatures and forgotten magic. The deeper you go, the more twisted and unnatural the woods become.
The Monster: (For now, let's keep this"
```

**Impact:**
- **BLOCKS** character creation completion
- Incomplete character sheets generated
- Context files not properly created
- User experience severely degraded

**Technical Cause:**
- Collaborative creation prompts too verbose
- No token limit management during character creation
- Conversation history accumulating without pruning

**Required Fix:**
- Implement token counting for collaborative prompts
- Add conversation summarization between phases
- Optimize prompt templates for token efficiency

**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours  
**Business Value:** Critical (system functionality)

### **[ ] BUG-004: Player Preferences Not Transmitted to LLM** ‚öôÔ∏è
**Priority:** Critical  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** BLOCKING  
**Reported:** 2025-06-20  
**Component:** Backend - Preference Integration & Prompt Building

**Description:**  
Player preferences from "Tell Us About Yourself" form not being sent to LLM during collaborative character creation, making personalization impossible.

**Impact:**
- **BLOCKS** core value proposition of personalized character creation
- LLM cannot reference stored preferences
- Generic responses instead of tailored suggestions
- Collaborative creation loses primary benefit

**Technical Cause:**
```typescript
// In buildCollaborativeCreationPrompt()
// ‚ùå Player preferences not properly integrated into prompt
const playerPreferencesSection = context.playerPreferences ? `...` : 'Standard D&D adventure style';
```

**Required Fix:**
- Ensure preferences properly passed through collaborative creation pipeline
- Add preference validation and logging
- Include preferences in all collaborative creation prompts

**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours  
**Business Value:** Critical (core feature)

### **[ ] BUG-005: Character Creation Phase Transition System Failure** üé®
**Priority:** Critical  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** BLOCKING  
**Reported:** 2025-06-20  
**Component:** UI - State Management & Phase Progression

**Description:**  
Automatic phase transitions (concept ‚Üí background ‚Üí world) fail due to prompt misunderstanding and lack of manual controls. Users cannot properly discuss each stage.

**Failure Example:**
```
User: "lets start character creation"
LLM: "Okay, let's flesh this out. I'm still thinking about the 'start character creation' concept..."
```

**Impact:**
- **BLOCKS** proper collaborative creation flow
- Users cannot complete concept stage properly
- Forced transitions prevent thorough discussion
- System jumps phases without user consent

**Technical Cause:**
- No manual phase transition controls
- Automatic progression based on single message
- LLM misinterpreting user intent
- Missing phase completion validation

**Required Fix:**
- Add manual "Next Phase" buttons
- Implement phase completion confirmation
- Allow extended discussion within each phase
- Add phase progress indicators

**Estimated Effort:** 6 hours  
**Business Value:** Critical (user experience)

- UI components not refreshed after creation

**Required Fix:**
- Implement proper character creation finalization
- Add "Finalize Character" button
- Trigger context file generation
- Refresh all UI components after creation

**Estimated Effort:** 3 hours  
**Business Value:** High (system integration)

**Priority:** High  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** READY  
**Reported:** 2025-06-20  
**Component:** Backend - LLM Prompt Engineering & Content Generation

**Description:**  
LLM consistently uses same location names (especially "Oakhaven") across different characters and playthroughs, reducing variety and immersion.

**Impact:**
- Reduces replay value
- Breaks immersion with repetitive content
- Suggests prompt engineering issues
- Poor user experience for multiple characters

**Technical Cause:**
- Prompts not encouraging location name variety
- No seed/randomization for content generation
- Missing location name database or constraints
- LLM defaulting to common fantasy tropes

**Required Fix:**
