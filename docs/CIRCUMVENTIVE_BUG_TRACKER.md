# D&D Webapp - Bug Tracker (REVISED STRATEGY)

**Project:** D&D Webapp - Enhanced Traditional Character Creation + Procedural World Building  
**Development Philosophy:** Context-Rich Gameplay Through Structured Creation  
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-20

---

## **üéØ STRATEGIC PIVOT: Traditional + Procedural Approach**

**DECISION:** Backlog Collaborative Character Creation system in favor of:
1. **Enhanced Traditional Character Creation** - Rich manual forms with better UX
2. **Procedural World Building System** - AI generates world from character + preferences
3. **Single Unified Pipeline** - No more dual UX paths creating complexity

**BENEFITS:**
- ‚úÖ **Eliminates 80% of current bugs** (all collaborative creation issues)
- ‚úÖ **Single codebase to maintain** - no dual pipeline complexity
- ‚úÖ **Faster development** - focus on one excellent system
- ‚úÖ **Same context richness** - procedural world building provides personalization
- ‚úÖ **Better UX consistency** - one polished creation flow

---

## **üîÑ BACKLOGGED BUGS (Collaborative Creation)**

**Moving to Backlog (Future Consideration):**
- ~~BUG-001~~ - Campaign Creation Failure After Collaborative Setup
- ~~BUG-002~~ - Prompt Inspector System Failure (collaborative specific)
- ~~BUG-003~~ - LLM Context Window Overflow During Character Creation
- ~~BUG-004~~ - Player Preferences Not Transmitted to LLM
- ~~BUG-005~~ - Character Creation Phase Transition System Failure

**REASON:** Collaborative system creates more complexity than value. Traditional + Procedural approach achieves same goals with better UX.

- **Relationships:** Important people, allies, enemies, family
- **Preferences Integration:** Favorite themes, narrative style, content preferences
- **World Influence:** Preferred setting tone, threat types, adventure style

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface EnhancedCharacterData {
  // Basic D&D Info
  name: string;
  class: string;
  background: string;
  race: string;
  
  // Character Depth
  personality: string[];
  motivations: string;
  fears: string;
  goals: string;
  
  // Background Story
  origin: string;
  importantEvent: string;
  relationships: NPC[];
  
  // World Preferences
  settingTone: 'gritty' | 'heroic' | 'mysterious' | 'epic';
  threatTypes: string[];
  adventureStyle: string;
  
  // Player Preferences
  favoriteThemes: string[];
  narrativeStyle: string;
  contentPreferences: any;
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours  
**Business Value:** Critical (replaces collaborative system)

### **[ ] PRIORITY-002: Procedural World Building System** ‚öôÔ∏è
**Priority:** Critical  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** NEW FOCUS  
**Component:** Backend - World Generation

**Description:**  
Create AI-powered world building system that generates rich, personalized campaign world from enhanced character data and player preferences.

**World Building Features:**
- **Setting Generation:** Towns, regions, geography based on character background
- **NPC Creation:** Important characters from character's history + new faces
- **Threat Development:** Conflicts and mysteries matching player preferences
- **Location Details:** Specific places relevant to character's story
- **Plot Hooks:** Adventure opportunities tied to character motivations

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface ProceduralWorld {
  setting: {
    mainLocation: Location;
    nearbyAreas: Location[];
    atmosphere: string;
    threats: Threat[];
  };
  
  npcs: {
    fromBackground: NPC[];
    newContacts: NPC[];
    antagonists: NPC[];
  };
  
  plotHooks: {
    personal: PlotHook[];
    local: PlotHook[];
    overarching: PlotHook[];
  };
  
  startingScenario: {
    location: string;
    situation: string;
    immediateChoices: string[];
  };
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 6 hours  
**Business Value:** Critical (core differentiation)

### **[ ] PRIORITY-003: World Building Prompt Engineering** ‚öôÔ∏è
**Priority:** High  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** NEW FOCUS  
**Component:** Backend - Prompt Optimization

**Description:**  
Create specialized prompts for world building that eliminate generic scenarios by using rich character context.

**Prompt Features:**
- **Character-Driven World Building:** Use character background to shape world
- **Preference Integration:** Match player's favorite themes and styles
- **Location Variety:** Prevent repetitive "Oakhaven" syndrome
- **Personal Stakes:** Create scenarios that matter to THIS character
- **Rich Context Files:** Generate comprehensive world documentation

**Example Prompt Structure:**
```typescript
const worldBuildingPrompt = `
Create a personalized D&D world for:

CHARACTER: ${character.name}, ${character.class} with ${character.background} background
PERSONALITY: ${character.personality.join(', ')}
MOTIVATIONS: ${character.motivations}
ORIGIN: ${character.origin}

PLAYER PREFERENCES:
- Themes: ${preferences.favoriteThemes.join(', ')}
- Style: ${preferences.narrativeStyle}
- Setting Tone: ${character.settingTone}

Generate:
1. Starting location (NOT generic fantasy town)
2. 3 important NPCs from character's past
3. Current local threat/mystery
4. Personal stakes for this character
5. Opening scenario with immediate choices

Make everything specific to THIS character's story.
`;
```

**Estimated Effort:** 3 hours  
**Business Value:** High (solves generic content issue)

## **üîß REMAINING TRADITIONAL PIPELINE BUGS**

### **[ ] BUG-006: Context System Integration Failure** ‚öôÔ∏è
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Component:** Backend - Context Files & Character Sheet Integration

**Description:**  
Traditional character creation doesn't properly update character interface components.

**Enhanced Fix for New Approach:**
- Generate character sheet from enhanced form data
- Create rich context files from procedural world building
- Update all UI components with new character + world data
- Ensure seamless transition to gameplay
